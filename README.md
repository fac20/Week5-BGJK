# Week5-BGJK
# INTRO
The project this week is to build a web app that stores data in a PostgreSQL database.

# Project was not completed so the app is not completely functional.

If cloning the app to run it you need to enter the follwing to reach each page:
- to run your code people should clone your repo, and then run npm install.
- npm run dev 
- you need access to the .env table to check the tables through psql. 
- website has been updated with css changes to create user handler that allows us to submit to our database but it's in a branch yet to be merged.
- please message if you have any questions. 


# THEME
Spill your beans a site for you to spill your toughts whether cute, angry or funny. From a pet peeve to compliment it's up to you what you spill.

## Core
- As a user, I want to: submit information to your site for anyone to see
- As a user, I want to: come back to your site later and see what I posted is still there
- Since this project is open-ended you'll need to write your own more specific user stories once you know what you want to build.

## Acceptance Criteria
- A form for users to submit data
- A page showing all the data
- Semantic form elements with correctly associated labels
- A Postgres database hosted on Heroku
- A schema describing your database in your README
- Tests for server routes and database access
- Not process user input as SQL commands
- Hidden environment variables (i.e. not on GitHub)

## Stretch criteria
- A way to view filtered/sorted data, instead of just all of it
- GitHub Actions CI setup to run your tests when you push
